This program is part of a larger project where a cube designed for storage of spices for the visually impaired, has 9 buttons on top.
The first 6 buttons can be used to store audio that's recorded using (any of) the last 3 buttons.
Both Pyaudio and PiBorg Gamepad libraries need to be installed.
This has been tested on a mic and 9 arcade-like buttons with success.
